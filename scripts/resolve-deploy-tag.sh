# Rewrites .release-tag, on a deployment, to the version of the build being
# deployed for CI_COMMIT_SHA. Card #461.
#
# Runs after find-commit-tag.sh, which writes .release-tag and
# .release-tag-reused:
#
#   - reused=true: the commit already carries a semver git tag, because a
#     deploy of it succeeded before. Deploy that same build again, so a commit
#     never runs under two versions and its git tag always names what is
#     deployed (the plugin's push-tag refuses a second tag on one commit).
#   - reused=false: the commit has never been deployed. Builds take the
#     pipeline number as their patch (compute-release-tag.sh), so nothing in
#     git names the build to use; publish-image also pushes each green
#     build as :commit-<sha>, so read the version from that image's label: it
#     is the latest green build of this commit.
#
# Found through the commit, not CI_PIPELINE_PARENT, because a restarted
# deployment and a deployment promoted from another deployment both have a
# deployment pipeline as their parent, not the push pipeline that built the
# image.
#
# Usage: resolve-deploy-tag.sh   (in the workspace; needs a logged-in docker)
# Reads CI_COMMIT_SHA, and IMAGE_REPO (default registry.desync.link/bored).
