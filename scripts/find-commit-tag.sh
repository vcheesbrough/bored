#!/bin/sh
# On a deployment, looks up the semver git tag already on CI_COMMIT_SHA and
# writes what resolve-deploy-tag.sh reads. Card #461.
#
#   - tagged (deployed before):  .release-tag = that tag, .release-tag-reused = true
#   - untagged (never deployed): .release-tag empty,      .release-tag-reused = false
#
# The release-versions plugin's `compute` mode did this lookup before, but on
# an untagged commit it also "allocates" max(tag)+1 and logs it
# ("release tag allocated: 1.69.2"), a version no build ever has under
# pipeline-number patches. This logs only the real answer.
#
# Both tag forms are matched: an annotated tag's commit is on its peeled
# `refs/tags/<t>^{}` line, a lightweight tag's on its own line. Only plain
# MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH tags count (legacy `v1.x` tags are ignored). More than one
# on the commit is refused: a commit runs under one version.
#
# Usage: find-commit-tag.sh
# Reads CI_COMMIT_SHA, CI_REPO (owner/name), GITHUB_TOKEN; needs git.
