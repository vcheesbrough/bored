# Tests for scripts/resolve-deploy-tag.sh (card #461).
#
# Plain POSIX sh with no harness dependency, wired into the Dockerfile like the
# other script tests. A fake `docker` first on PATH stands in for the registry:
# it knows the images listed in $WORK_DIR/registry (one "<ref> <version label>"
# per line), fails `pull` for any other, and records every call. Each case runs
# in its own workspace holding the plugin's .release-tag/.release-tag-reused.
# Expected tags are literal strings.
