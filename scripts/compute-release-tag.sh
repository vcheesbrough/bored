# Prints the release tag for the image this push/manual pipeline builds:
# MAJOR.MINOR from the workspace Cargo.toml, PATCH = this pipeline's
# CI_PIPELINE_NUMBER. Card #461.
#
# Pipeline numbers are unique and increasing per repo, so no two builds share
# a version and nothing has to be reserved in git first: the git tag is pushed
# only after a successful deploy. Deployments do not use this script — they
# find the build to deploy through the commit (resolve-deploy-tag.sh).
#
# Usage: compute-release-tag.sh [path/to/Cargo.toml]   (default: ./Cargo.toml)
# Reads CI_PIPELINE_EVENT, CI_PIPELINE_NUMBER.
