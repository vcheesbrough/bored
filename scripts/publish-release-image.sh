# Pushes the image this push pipeline built and e2e-tested, under its version
# and as the commit's latest green build. Card #461.
#
#   1. Refuse if the registry already holds the version. Versions are
#      MAJOR.MINOR.<pipeline number>, unique only while Woodpecker's pipeline
#      counter is: if the repo is re-created in Woodpecker or its DB restored
#      from an old backup, numbers repeat, and pushing would silently replace
#      an image prod or a git tag may name. Only an explicit "not found" from
#      the registry lets the push go ahead; any other probe failure (auth,
#      network, 5xx) refuses, since it cannot rule the version out.
#   2. Push :<version>.
#   3. Push the same image as :commit-<sha>, which a deployment of a commit
#      never deployed before resolves to (resolve-deploy-tag.sh). A re-run of
#      the commit's push pipeline moves it to the newer build.
#
# Usage: publish-release-image.sh <version> <commit-sha>
# Reads IMAGE_REPO (default registry.desync.link/bored); needs a logged-in
# docker holding the built <repo>:<version> image.
